# Palette Picker

There are tons of color palette generators on the web, but none give me the combination of control and efficiency I want with an interface that's as simple as I'd like it to be. Enter this concept for a React app for quickly generating and applying color palettes that are informed by the principles of color theory and my personal UX sensibilities. Simply pick a target hue, adjust the values to your liking, and you'll have a palette sized and selected to your requested parameters.
