There are tons of color palette generators on the web, but none give me the combination of control and efficiency I want with an interface that's as simple as I'd like it to be. Enter this concept for a React app for quickly generating and applying color palettes that are informed by the principles of color theory and my personal UX sensibilities. Simply pick a target hue, adjust the values to your liking, and you'll have a palette sized and selected to your requested parameters.

It's still in the early stages of development, but as a recovering digital designer, I've spent a lot of time thinking about color theory, palette generators, UX, and how none of the existing color scheming sites offer a featureset and user experience that rivals the one in my head. I'm excited to put these ideas to practice, and with luck, create a system that makes the process of palette creation more fun and efficient.
