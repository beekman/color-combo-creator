There are tons of color palette generators on the web, but none give me the combination of control and efficiency with an interface that's as simple as I'd like it to be. Enter this concept for a React app for quickly generating and applying color palettes that are informed by the principles of color theory and my personal UX sensibilities. Simply pick a target hue, adjust the values to your liking, and you'll have a palette sized and selected to your requested parameters.
